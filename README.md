# Sign-language-recognition-using-CNN
Designed a model that detects sign language and provides corresponding alphabets, for communication with normal hearing individuals. Computer Vision, MediaPipe, Google Teachable Machine, Neural Networks.

Hardware Requirements:

The Hardware Interfaces Required are:
Camera: Good quality, 3MP
Ram: Minimum 8GB or higher
Processor: Intel CORE i3 or higher
Monitor: 15” or 17” colour monitor

Software Requirements:
The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:
Python (3.7 above)
IDE (Pycharm)
Numpy
cv2 (openCV)
Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing)
